[mcp]

# Servers are configured as a list. If an entry only has `url`, BlueGPT passes
# it directly to `fastmcp.Client(...)` (transport inference from URL/path).
#
# If an entry has additional fields, it is treated as a full MCP server config
# and passed to `Client(...)` as an MCPConfig structure.

# Shorthand: URL/path only (auto-infer transport)

# name = "time_helper_http"
